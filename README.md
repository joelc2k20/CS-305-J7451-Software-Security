# CS-305-J7451-Software-Security
Client and Software Requirements:
Artemis Financial is a fintech company that specializes in online investment and financial management services. They approached me to address potential security vulnerabilities in their web-based investment platform. Their main concern was ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data and transactions.

Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities:
During the assessment, I conducted a thorough code review and penetration testing of Artemis Financial's platform. I successfully identified and documented vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and inadequate authentication mechanisms.

Importance of Secure Coding:
Coding securely is crucial to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the platform's reliability. Software security adds value to the company's overall well-being by safeguarding customer trust, avoiding data breaches, and complying with industry regulations.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects:
One challenge during the vulnerability assessment was identifying hidden vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Collaborating with Artemis Financial's development team to understand the application's architecture was helpful in this regard.

Increasing Security Layers and Mitigation Techniques:
I recommended implementing input validation, using parameterized queries, and adopting security libraries to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. To assess vulnerabilities in the future, I would use a combination of automated security scanning tools, manual code reviews, and regular security audits.

Functional and Secure Code:
After refactoring the code, I conducted thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. I used security testing techniques such as penetration testing to verify that the code changes did not introduce new vulnerabilities.

Resources and Tools Used:
During the assessment, I utilized tools like Burp Suite for web application testing, SonarQube for code analysis, and OWASP guidelines for secure coding practices. These resources and tools could be valuable for future assignments.

Showcasing to Future Employers:
From this assignment, I would showcase my ability to identify and address critical security vulnerabilities, my proficiency in secure coding practices, collaboration with development teams, and my comprehensive approach to software testing and verification.
